I am currently in the final year of my undergraduate studies at Hainan University, where I hold the position of student researcher within my college's laboratory.

<font color="red">I am actively seeking a Ph.D. position commencing in the Fall of 2025!</font>


## Research Interests
My research interests primarily lie in the domains of graph neural networks and machine learning, with a particular emphasis on reasoning over dynamic systems, such as temporal knowledge graphs, and graph representation learning. Additionally, I am open to extending my research interests to related fields, including common sense reasoning and causal inference.

## News
