I'm a final-year undergraduate student at Hainan University, serving as a student researcher in my college lab.

<font color="red">I am actively seeking a Ph.D. position commencing in the Fall of 2025!</font>

Research Interests
======
My research interests primarily lie in the domains of graph neural networks and machine learning, with a particular emphasis on reasoning over dynamic systems, such as temporal knowledge graphs, and graph representation learning. Additionally, I am open to extending my research interests to related fields, including causal inference.
